MINERVA is a webservice using the Java Server Faces 2 technology. The server side, including data parsing, integration, annotation and verification, is implemented in Java 8. The platform uses the Postgres SQL database for data storage and the Hibernate framework as a middle layer between web server and database. The user web-interface is generated using JSF and PrimeFaces. The displayed content is visualized by OpenLayers or Google Maps API, dedicated JavaScript and CSS.
